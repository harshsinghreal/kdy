Finding navigation on any road is now easy due to the GPS which will fetch your location and <b>provides the fastest route</b> to reach there.
But what about the locations you can't find using GPS for example PC lab in an university, car location in a mall or cafeteria in a tourist place.  

<i><b>Let’s imagine a scenario...</b></i>   You have gone to a grand mall like ‘DLF MALL’ in Noida in a car with your friends or family. You have parked your car in parking area at “position F2” and went to shopping mall, enjoying your day. It’s time to go your residence, and there are more than 500 locations where individual can park their car. Now you know it’s very common that one forgets the route where they might have parked their car. 

SO, HERE WE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION IN THE FORM OF <i><strong>“KDY - KNOW DIRECTION YOURSELF AN ANDROID NAVIGATION APP”</strong></i>, which will be your personal guide without charging any cost.   

What you have to do?  Just scan nearby QR code, and choose your destination. OR Enter your current location and choose your destination, Now your personal guide is ready to show you the optimal path for your destination.

Currently, we have introduced it for our campus. Being the new admission in the campus, the very first problem that you are going to face is finding the classrooms and lab. KDY will guide you in visuals, audio and text, that’s what makes it more user friendly to use.
